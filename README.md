Data sets considered: mcdonalds_nutrition.csv; starbucks_nutrition.csv

Problem Statement: Compare nutrient value in food served in McDonalds and Starbucks

1. Loaded data frames into Pandas data frames and verified if the data frames had been loaded

2. Using dimensionality reduction converted data of higher dimensionality (mcdonalds_nutrition.csv) into lower dimensionality to (starbucks_nutrition.csv) and combined the two datasets using concat function.

3. Compared the nutrition value in food served in both restaurants and represented it graphically using a bar graph in python.
